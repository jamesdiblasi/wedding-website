# p-profiler

Run a promise (perhaps with p-queue) generating a profiler json suitable to be consumed inside Chrome or Edge devtools to be analyzed

## Install

```
$ npm install p-profiler
```

## Usage

The p-profiler library is a class. Simply instantiate a `Profiler` class to be used to run the task functions (functions that generate a Promise). This example uses `p-graph` to demonstrate how to use this library. The task functions in this example is wrapped inside a profiler and a promise queue to control concurrency

```js
import Profiler from "p-profiler";
import pGraph from "p-graph";
import PQueue from "p-queue";

const concurrency = 3;

// Create a profiler with the same concurrency as the p-graph
const profiler = new Profiler({ concurrency });
const queue = new PQueue({ concurrency });

const putOnShirt = () =>
  queue.add(profiler.run(() => Promise.resolve("put on your shirt")));
const putOnShorts = () =>
  queue.add(profiler.run(() => Promise.resolve("put on your shorts")));
const putOnJacket = () =>
  queue.add(profiler.run(() => Promise.resolve("put on your jacket")));
const putOnShoes = () =>
  queue.add(profiler.run(() => Promise.resolve("put on your shoes")));
const tieShoes = () =>
  queue.add(profiler.run(() => Promise.resolve("tie your shoes")));

const graph = [
  [putOnShoes, tieShoes],
  [putOnShirt, putOnJacket],
  [putOnShorts, putOnJacket],
  [putOnShorts, putOnShoes],
];

await pGraph(graph).run(); // returns a promise that will resolve when all the tasks are done from this graph in order

// This writes out a
profiler.output();
```
